## ‚ùå TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem 1: Form submits but no email received**

**Possible causes:**

- Wrong Form ID
- Email not verified in Formspree
- Email in spam folder
- Formspree account not set up

**Solutions:**

1. Check spam folder
2. Wait 5 minutes (emails can be delayed)
3. Verify Form ID is correct
4. Check Formspree dashboard for submissions
5. Verify email address in Formspree settings

---

### **Problem 2: Error message when submitting**

**Error: "Form not found"**

- Your Form ID is wrong
- Check Formspree dashboard for correct ID
- Make sure you copied it exactly

**Error: "Invalid email"**

- Email format is wrong in Formspree
- Use: contact@helloforma.org (no spaces)

**Error: "Submission failed"**

- Check internet connection
- Try different browser
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

---

### **Problem 3: Form redirects to Formspree page**

**This is normal for first submission!**

- Formspree shows a confirmation page
- Click "Confirm your email"
- Check email and click confirmation link
- After that, form will work normally

**To avoid this:**

- Set up a custom thank you page (merci.html)
- Add this to your form:
  ```html
  <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="merci.html" />
  ```

---

### **Problem 4: Spam submissions**

**Enable spam protection:**

1. Log into Formspree
2. Go to your form settings
3. Enable "reCAPTCHA"
4. Enable "Honeypot"
5. Save settings

---

## üé® CUSTOMIZATION (Optional)

### **Add Custom Thank You Page:**

Add this line inside your form (after the opening `<form>` tag):

```html
<input type="hidden" name="_next" value="merci.html" />
```

This redirects to your thank you page after submission.

---

### **Add Custom Subject Line:**

Add this line inside your form:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="Nouveau contact HelloForma" />
```

This sets a custom email subject line.

---

### **Add CC Email:**

Add this line to send copies to multiple emails:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="_cc" value="backup@example.com" />
```
